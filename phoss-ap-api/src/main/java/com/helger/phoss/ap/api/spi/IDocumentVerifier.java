/**
 * Base interface of the two document verifier SPIs, carrying what both directions have in common.
 * <p>
 * It exists so that a verifier implementing {@link IInboundDocumentVerifierSPI} <em>and</em>
 * {@link IOutboundDocumentVerifierSPI} - like the bundled phorm verifier - inherits a single
 * {@link #getVerifierName()} instead of two unrelated defaults, which Java would reject. This is
 * deliberately <b>not</b> a merge of the two SPIs: the inbound and the outbound verification have
 * different semantics (fail modes, deferral and MLS responses apply to inbound only), so the
 * verification methods stay separate.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It deliberately carries no <code>SPI</code> suffix and no
 * {@link com.helger.annotation.style.IsSPIInterface} annotation: it is never loaded via
 * {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} itself, only its two sub-interfaces are.
