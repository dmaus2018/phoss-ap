# Directory for external extension jars (custom DB drivers, SPI extensions).
# Any jar placed here is added to the classpath at runtime via LOADER_PATH below,
# without rebuilding the application jar. It is a plain directory (not a VOLUME) so it
# works both when bind-mounted from the host and when extensions are baked into a
# derived image via "COPY my-extension.jar /ext/". See phoss-ap-extension-demo.
#
# Both directories are group owned by GID 0 with the group permissions mirroring the
# owner permissions, so the image also runs as an arbitrary non-root UID - Kubernetes
# with a "restricted" PodSecurity profile (runAsNonRoot / runAsUser) and OpenShift both
# assign a random UID but keep GID 0. This must happen before the VOLUME instructions,
# because changes to a volume path made after its VOLUME line are discarded.

# Store all runtime data below the /var/phoss-ap/data volume declared above. Without
# this, the "global.datapath=generated/" default of the bundled application.properties
# is resolved relative to the working directory "/", so documents and AS4 dumps end up
# in the ephemeral /generated - unwritable for a non-root UID, and lost on container
# removal even for root.

# "--chmod" requires BuildKit (default since Docker 23; the release build uses buildx).
# Without it, files added from a remote URL get mode 0600 root:root, which a non-root
# UID cannot read - see https://github.com/phax/phoss-ap/issues/79
